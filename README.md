The game randomly assigns a turn start. Which will be indicated by an appearing turn indicator below the boards. 

On computer turn start, computer randomly selects a square unless they get a hit where they choose nearby squares until they sink the ship. On player hit, a hit message and indicator will show up. Hit indicators will appear on board and on player ship indicators on a panel below to indicate hits. These will be red for hits. Whites will indicate misses. A countdown will go off before to put time in between turns.

On player turn start, player can click on an empty computer square on the board to indicate where they want to fire. They click the fire button to confirm and recieve a hit indication.
