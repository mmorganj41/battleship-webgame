# Battleship

This is a browser-based version of "Battleship", a game of strategy and luck. You command your fleet of battleships to sink your enemy's. Will you emerge victorious or waterlogged?

## Getting Started:

Are you ready to jump aboard? Set sail by employing one of the options below:

- Clone or download the repository to play offline.
- Play online through github's deployment [here](https://mmorganj41.github.io/battleship-webgame/)

### Setup

![Setup](/imgs/SetupSS.png)

Before playing, you must decide on a strategy and choose how to place each of your 5 battleships. You can do so by dragging any of your blue ships on the bottom of the screen to the 10 square x 10 square board. By default, all ships will populate the board horizontally to the right from where you've placed it; if you'd like for them to go vertically downwards, click the orientation icon on the bottom left of the screen. And don't worry! It's okay if you make a mistake, clicking on any greyed out ship on the bottom of the screen will remove that ship from your board, and you'll be free to replace it.

The ships are as follows:
- Destroyer: 2 squares
- Cruiser: 3 squares
- Submarine: 3 squares
- Battleship: 4 squares
- Carrier: 5 squares

If you're all set, press the big red start button! The game will have randomly decided who will go first, and you'll be on your way to victory!

### Playing the game

When it's your turn, you have to decide where to fire your artillery. You can do so by first clicking on a square that hasn't previously been chosen and then click on the big red button that now reads "Fire" (or press F).

Depending on your strategy (or luck), you'll be informed whether you hit your opponent's vessels or not. Red means a hit. White means a miss. The ships at the bottom of the screen will tell you how close any of the ships are to sinking.

Unless the game is over, the computer will make its move, and it will similarly select a square to fire on your board and informing you of the outcome.

This will continue until all of your or your opponent's ships are underwater.

### Winning (or Losing) the game

Whoever sinks the other's 5 ships first wins the game. The scoreboard on the left will track the results, and you will have to press the reset button towards the bottom middle of the screen to reset the board and start again.

### Frustrated? or too easy?

You can reset at any time if you feel the computer got "too lucky".

Feel free to select hardmode on the bottom right of the screen to play against a seemingly precognizant computer if the game was too easy. 

## Next Steps:

While the game is largely functional as it is, there remains further potential for polishing the design and generally improving the css, including:

- Creating explosion, miss, and sinking animations
- Modifying the dragging events to completely dispaly the ship on board
- Making css more sleek and modern
