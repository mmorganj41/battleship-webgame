User Story:

Game has two boards, one with player info and the other with computer.

On a new game, player can drag each of their 5 ships (which can be rotated). The computer will randomly generate ship locations which will be hidden from the player.

The game randomly assigns a turn start. Which will be indicated by an appearing turn indicator below the boards. 

On computer turn start, computer randomly selects a square unless they get a hit where they choose nearby squares until they sink the ship. On player hit, a hit message and indicator will show up. Hit indicators will appear on board and on player ship indicators on a panel below to indicate hits. These will be red for hits. Whites will indicate misses. A countdown will go off before to put time in between turns.

On player turn start, player can click on an empty computer square on the board to indicate where they want to fire. They click the fire button to confirm and recieve a hit indication. 

The scoreboard on the side indicates turn # and whose turn it is along with player and computer wins. 

A reset button restarts the game.
